SRTA Cognitive Architecture Project
This repository serves as the experimental testbed for the next generation of the SRTA (Systematic, Relevant, Transparent, Actionable) framework. It explores advanced concepts in AI deliberation, cognitive architectures, and emergent intelligence, building upon the foundational work presented in the "Multi-Agent SRTA" paper.

Parent Repository (Published Research): https://github.com/ubunturbo/srta-ai-accountability

Research Vision
This project investigates the hypothesis that sophisticated cognitive processes, analogous to human introspection and dialectical reasoning, can emerge from structured interactions between AI agents. We move beyond static, single-pass evaluations to explore dynamic, recursive, and hierarchical models of computational thought.

Our goal is to transition SRTA from an evaluation tool into a practical, computational model of thinking itself.

Implementations
This repository contains proof-of-concept scripts for two advanced cognitive models:

1. fibonacci_srta.py - The "Introspective" Model
Concept: Simulates a single mind deepening its understanding over time through a process of self-reflection.

Mechanism: A recursive loop where agents re-evaluate their own conclusions. The depth and scope of this "thinking" process are guided by the Fibonacci sequence, mirroring natural patterns of growth and complexity.

Purpose: To model cognitive depth and the process of reaching a robust, well-considered conclusion.

2. dialectical_srta.py - The "Dialectical" Model
Concept: Simulates a structured, multi-perspective dialogue to forge a higher-level understanding.

Mechanism: A hierarchical architecture based on philosophical dialectics. Two agents (Thesis, Antithesis) provide conflicting viewpoints, and a third agent (Synthesis) resolves their conflict to create a new, emergent conclusion. This structure is analogous to theological models like the Trinity.

Purpose: To model cognitive creativity and the process of generating novel insights from conflicting information.

How to Test
Both scripts are self-contained and use mock LLM functions, allowing for immediate execution and testing of the core logic without API keys.

# To test the introspective model
python fibonacci_srta.py

# To test the dialectical model
python dialectical_srta.py

Next Steps
The ultimate goal of this research is to integrate these two models, creating a system that can dynamically choose the appropriate "thinking mode"—deep introspection or creative dialogue—based on the complexity of the problem at hand. This research has the potential to bridge the gap between computer science and the humanities, exploring the very nature of thought, reason, and perhaps even consciousness, in a computationally verifiable way.
